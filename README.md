This is a project to learn R and automated analysis pipelines.

# AdvancedR3:

Check out the project's [website](https://tuagyl.github.io/AdvancedR3/)

This is an exercise to demonstrate automatic styling.

-   It's cool
-   If it works

Also we check what happens when we make a super super long sentence to
see if the breaks work.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: The original lipidomics csv and a readme file
-   `doc/`: The learning Quarto doc and a readme file
-   `R/`: A script for functions and also a readme file.

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
